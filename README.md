# CAMlander

CAMlander is a user friendly calendar app for daily usage.

## Installation
You should install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) first to use this application. Be sure to install [docker-compose package](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) too if you are using Linux or Mac. It comes with the installation in Windows so it should be fine.

1- Download the source code to a folder. Extract it if it is zipped.

2- Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder, or use this command for Windows.
```bash
cd THE_PROJECT_LOCATION
```

3- After you are sure that the terminal is in the project folder, type the following command.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

4- Wait for it to finish initialization. If you are getting an error, be sure that Docker application is up and running.

5- Open your web browser and go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Ignore the adress in bash.

6- If you cannot acces to the project, please also try 0.0.0.0:8000 and 127.0.0.1:8000 adresses.

## Usage
In order to use the CAMlendar, you need to create an account and log in. Navigate to the registration page using the navigation bar.

After you log in, you will be welcomed by your own calendar. You can easily add an event by just clicking the date you want. You can set the details if you want, but if you don't want to bother, just give it a title and CAMlendar will handle the rest.

Do you have an event that lasts longer than a day? No worries, CAMlendar got you covered. You can just select the dates easily by dragging the mouse on them. Of course, you can arrange the hours or change dates afterward, so don't worry about that.
